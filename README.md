# Basic-Antivirus-using-Python
This project is a basic antivirus scanner implemented in Python. It demonstrates fundamental techniques for malware detection through signature-based scanning. The scanner is designed to identify potential threats by comparing file contents against a database of known malware signatures.

**Features:**

**Signature-Based Detection:** The scanner utilizes a signature database containing known malware patterns to identify suspicious files.
**Comprehensive Scanning:** It supports scanning of individual files as well as entire directories, ensuring thorough coverage.
**Custom Signature Testing:** Users can create custom signatures to validate the effectiveness of the scanner against specific threats.
**User-Friendly Interface:** The scanner provides a simple command-line interface for users to input directories to scan, enhancing usability.

**Technologies Used:**

**Python:** for scripting and automation. 
**File I/O Operations:** for reading file contents and directory traversal. 
**Byte Pattern Matching:** for detecting malware signatures.
